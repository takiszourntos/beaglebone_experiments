The BlinkyButton PRU Project is intended to provide a learning context for developing applications with the real-time hardware resources of the AM335x MCU, under Linux. The AM335x is the basis for the open-source Beaglebone Black and Pocket Beagle development platforms and is a powerful chip for embedded applications, featuring 32-bit-wide data and address buses, 1-GHz clock frequency, ARM A8 core and a variety of useful microcontroller-esque resources like PWM, A/D conversion, flash-memory interfacing, as well as the usual peripheral buses (I2C, SPI, UART, CAN, etc.). In addition, the AM335x features two on-chip programmable real-time units (PRUs) which are themselves 32-bit RISC cores operating at 200-MHz. Because real-time operation is often critical in embedded systems applications, getting into the PRU subsystem (PRUSS) is important for developers who like the potential of Linux but need a hard real-time solution. This project covers the full range of a PRU application, from electronics to software.
